This repository builds the compiler and related binutils, etc. for the FRC arm architecture that runs on National Instruments hardware.  

The compiler has not yet been released for Ubuntu 16.04 or 16.10, so this repository can be used to build.

Installation guidance
=====================

The compiler that is built for the FRC RoboRIO arm architecture uses gcc-4.9 .  On newer systems, gcc-5 and gcc-6 are likely also installed.  In order to build the gcc-4.9 series, a gcc-4.9 series compiler is recommended.  There may be issues with building using gcc-5 or gcc-6 due to some language standards changes.  It is possible to switch compilers using update-alternatives or similar.

A install-dependencies.sh file will install the necessary support programs and libraries to build the Ubuntu/Debian .deb files.

Instructions
============

1. Make your system use gcc-4.9 and g++-4.9 for `/usr/bin/gcc` and `/usr/bin/g++` (switch back to original compiler version after this build is complete)
1. Run `download.sh` to retrieve the necessary source files
1. Run `install-dependencies.sh` to install build dependencies
1. Run `cd deb` and then `make`
